"""
Given a set of candidate numbers (candidates) (without duplicates) and a target number (target),
find all unique combinations in candidates where the candidate numbers sums to target.

The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times.

Note:

1. All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
2. The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example 1:
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
A solution set is:
[
  [7],
  [2,2,3]
]

Example 2:
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [2,2,2,2],
  [2,3,3],
  [3,5]
]
